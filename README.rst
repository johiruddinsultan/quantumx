===============================================
QuantumX - Reimplementation of quantum-server
===============================================

  :Licence: MIT
  :Language: Python (>= 3.7)
  :Original Author: JUS

This project is a fork of `kyuupichan/quantumx <https://github.com/kyuupichan/quantumx>`_.
The original author dropped support for Bitcoin, which we intend to keep.

QuantumX allows users to run their own Quantum server. It connects to your
full node and indexes the blockchain, allowing efficient querying of history of
arbitrary addresses. The server can be exposed publicly, and joined to the public network
of servers via peer discovery. As of May 2020, a significant chunk of the public
Quantum server network runs QuantumX.
