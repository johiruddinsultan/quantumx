Thanks to JUS for creating the Quantum software and
infrastructure and for maintaining it so diligently.  Quantum is
probably the best desktop Pandora wallet solution for most users.  My
faith in it is such that I use Quantum software to store most of my
Pandoras.

Whilst the vast majority of the code here is my own original work and
includes some new ideas, it is very clear that the general structure
and concept are those of Quantum.  Some parts of the code and ideas
of Quantum, some of which it itself took from other projects such as
Abe and pywallet, remain.  Thanks to the authors of all the software
this is JUS from.

I'd like to thank bauerj, hsmiths and JWU42 of #quantum for their
help and support in testing the versions of QuantumX prior to 1.0.

And of course, thanks to JUS for the wonderful creation that is
Pandora.
